this is a sentence
this is another sentence
I don't know. How to use the shift key?
i also don't know how to type a period
if only there were people smarter than i who could do this
maybe they could make a pull request to fix this
i'd probably merge it in
they would have learned how to do pull requests in the process
this would benefit all parties involved
if i had thought this out, perhaps the number of sentences would match the number of people
if that were the case then they could all make a pull request for a specific sentence
i'd have to let them know which sentence they had to fix first
perhaps i'd just randomly assign a number to each person
once the number was assigned they would know which sentence to fix
